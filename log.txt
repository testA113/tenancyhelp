14/01/24 I'm currently trying out the fusion retriever to query the tenancy docs. 
The fusion retriever didn't work, but RouterRetriever did. It decides one or many retrievers to use for a chat_engine. For example it will only include cases if I ask for cases that relate to the problem that I'm facing as a tenant.
Next I need to add the residential tenancy act to the index, and also the remaining tenancy tribunal docs
18/1/24 The answers are good, but sometimes the tenancy services forms aren't relevant. There is a document summary function that I'll look into to hopefully give better results for this source.
